title: 11 hrs Connection Flight in Japan 
description: 09/4/2019 - the day where I have to fly back to New Jersey to finish my last semester at Rutgers. I bought a flight that need to stop in Japan for 11 hrs and also need to transfer from HND airport to NRT airport by myself. The plane arrived at 5am and departure at 5pm. I thought it would be a perfect timing to feel the <i>real</i> Japan. And I went, without any schedule ahead of time. I didn't even know what to take HND from to NRT...

## How This Happened
I have traveled to Japan with my family once and take connection flight a few times in Japan (in the same airport), but never have a time to experience myself.

Normally I would bought round-trip tickets to go back to Beijing, China or Bangkok, Thailand and come back a few months before the actual date where I planned to go back. But this time I guess I wasn't sure if I have time to go back to meet with my family so I bought it in the "last minute".

And from Newark, New Jersey to Bangkok, Thailand does not have a non-stop flight, it always need to stop somewhere, and mostly in Japan or Hong Kong. To be honest, taking a connection flight in different airport in a unfamilar country is terrifying, especially when they speak different language, use different currency, and 11 hours!

So I tried to make plans before hands, but everyone says different things about where I should visit. I also have tried to find a friend to take me to visit some of the places on my way from HND (the airport where I arrived) to NRT (the airport where I need to departure), but either they are too far away or does not have time. And I was also in the middle of finals so...
##### I planned NOTHING. Literally, NOTHING...
##### I didn't even know what train or subway to take after I arrived in HND airport...

So there I went, hooked ?? on a plane flying to Japan and I guess we will see how it goes. And there's 11 hours in between, I can definitely be in the other airport no matter how I find a way to get there.

## Real Fun Outside of Airport
I arrived in HND and got my luggages (I'm taking one large luggeage and a carry-on, with a small bagpack and mango sticky rice I bought in Bangkok's airport?) and I tried to find a way to NRT airport or a city to visit? I don't know, I couldn't understand the direction board in the airport lobby. So I want to ask someone, and there a station where they are seeming to sell the tickets for trains (?). Good thing is that the guy selling ticket is really nice, even though we don't understand each other and thanks to Google Translate we can communicate. 

He was giving me a few options to go to NRT airport, but they are all just taking trains from one station to another, or just taking connection between different trains in a hotel.. I don't want to visist a hotel.. So I ask him what about subways, and I got a subway map from there.

Subways in Japan is a mess.. In one line they have different subway?? How am I gonna take the right one when they look all alike? (Later on I found out subways in New York also having different lines in one lane.. okay.. then my favorite subway is Beijing's subway..) I again asked a few people, but due to different languages.. I still don't understand a thing. And one lady just said come with me I will show you. So I get on the subway, and trying to figure out how the map is (where am I and where should I go etc..), then the next station is NOT as show in the map..

I am really just have no idea where I was. And by carrying all the luggages, I finally found a seat, and after one stop one lady censured me about me and my stuff is taking another half seat that other people don't have enough space.. But good thing is that that lady is Chinese and I do speak Chinese! Finally someone who can speak the same language! And her pointed out where I was and where I can go...

![Image of First Station where I got off](assets/blog-img/japan/first-station.JPG) 

I took off at Ueno Station, b/c that lady said there is a park and some malls(?) and cultural institute and art galleries around that part. I found a luggage storage station inside the subway. Worth mentioning is that, Ueno Station is SUPER BIG that when I tried to go back and find my luggage I almost LOST inside..

I used Google Map, best friend in a place of unknown, to search what's outside, and luckily I found some place, but since it wasn't even 7am at that moment, most of the stores are not yet open, so I went to a part, the Ueno Onshi Park and finished my favorite Thai dessert, Mango Sticky Rice (where I bought in Bangkok Airport).

Saw some temples (I guess?) and beautiful Japanese style architectures.

One fun fact of Japanese that I observed while walking around is that, they visit a temple before work? They worship and kowtow sometimes and go to work later. Ueno is really a place I would recommand. I felt so lucky that I didn't went to other places and miss the fun in Ueno Onshi!

I went to a 7-11 store and bought some breakfast and found out there's a shopping street near by.

This temple is inside of the shopping streets. WOW..

And the best part is, there are a few art galleries and cultural institute in this area as well!

This is a vintage ticket collection store I found！

Tried some samples in the stores and they are really good！I wish I can buy them, but then it is impossible to bring it back to the US...

I got 2 Capsule toys lol, that looks so nice when its in Japan.

And one of them is a safe that I can actually lock it with my desired password! So Cool!

Funny thing is that I stored my luggage inside of this subway and I need to take the train to go the NRT airport, and I couldn't get into the subway station without a valid subway ticket. I talked to one of the conductor, and she gave me a temporary ticket to get in hahaha.

And there're so many stores inside this subway station. Ironically I bought a Taiwan's fountain pen there (I didn't know lol). Those packaging are soooo pretty and delicate! 
I bought the train ticket to NRT airport.

Another fun fact is that I got on the wrong train carriage, I think the one I went on is for people who have the "vip train card", they need to scan the their card on the top of that seat, and there's a light indicating if they have scanned it or not. 
![Image of train ticket](assets/blog-img/japan/train-ticket.JPG) 
At first I didn't know and there wasn't an empty seat as well, but then a guy said I could sit at his seat since he is getting off. But I don't have that VIP card and too scared to sit there and a conductor came and ask me to go to other carriage since I have too many luggages. So I stood the whole way..

## Fun in NRT
Finally I arrived at NRT airport station, and finished my journey this time at Japan. I feel like I just really love how they live their life exquisitely.

Another thing worth to mention is that, inside the NRT airport, they have a fixed station where they would show travelers about their culture. I think I've been there 3 times and each time they have different activities. In 2017, they gave you the opportunity to dress kimono in the color of your choice.

I think in 2018, I drew a Ukiyo-e style Kanagawa-oki Nami Ura. But I couldn't find a picture of that draw anymore.
And in 2019, it was a sand draw?

Anyhow, I would definitely recommand you to travel to Japan no matter how long time you have for the vacation. It is definitely worth it!
