title: How I built this website, and what I have leanrt..
description: I have planned to build a personal website since 09/2019, have tried to implement in so many ways. And finally deployed it in 09/2020ÔºÅTo be honest, a website doesn't take that long. The current verison of this website only took me less than a month. The hard part is to find the right way before you start!

In Sep 2019, I have an idea of building my personal website, but I never took a class in my University about how to build one. 
So I did what I usually do when I need to learn a new concept when studying computer science. Open YouTuBe, find a high rated video that go through the stuff I need to learn and start from there.
## First Failure 
Then I found a video about build a website using bootstrap, python, and Django framework. I bought a domain and hosting from NameCheap. Then after I finish implementing the basic website using Django and python, and trying to put it on NameCheap's hosting, the error occurs, and I realize that I didn't do much research before hand. NameCheap's hosting provides wordpress and other service for building a standard personal website, but it doesn't support python. So I again, YouTuBe about which hosting does support Python.
## Second Failure
On the second video the YouTuber that I learnt how to made a website from, mentioned that she is using Digital Ocean for hosting her website. Ok... and Digital Ocean is pricing based on minutes and other unit of time. So I bought a few minutes. And again, it does not work. I have no idea why, and Digital Ocean just keep charging me money like AWS.. (which is my third failure)
## Third Failure
Then when I almost gave up on it. A friend of mine mentioned that he have used AWS for hosting a website, and he can remotely help me with it. So then I created an account on AWS, and at this time, it still does not work as I expected. And after few months of creating this account but not actually use it for any purpose. It is charging me about $0.5 each month. And oddly I have tried to close it once, and it still charging..
## finally finally
A month later, I went to a Bootcamp that taught how to build a full stack application using Angular and .NET Core. Duing the bootcamp, I figured why don't I use Angular to try it out. It couldn't hurt more. So I tried. And did a tons of research before hands. About Angular, Angular CLI, Angular SSR (univerisal one I think), and AngularJS. Well, I didn't learn about React at that time so if I went back on time, I would use React for definitely since it's much simplier and it is just a personal website. 

## What I have used for this website:
Angular CLI for now, going to convert it to Angular SSR for later deployment.
Scully for this blog
Planning to build a small database using AWS for comments and interaction with users.

## What I have learnt:
JUST be patient, and do research of things before actually trying to implement something you don't know. Figure things our along the way. And start to accepting study from reading post and documentations and not just YouTube videos.
