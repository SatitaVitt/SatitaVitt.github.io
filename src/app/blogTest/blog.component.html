        <h1>11 hrs Connection Flight in JAPAN</h1>
        <h5>09/04/2019</h5>
        <h5 style="color:purple">Advanture</h5>
        <p>09/4/2019 - the day where I have to fly back to New Jersey to finish my last semester at Rutgers. I bought a flight that need to stop in Japan for 11 hrs and also need to transfer from HND airport to NRT airport by myself.
        <br>
        The plane arrived at 5am and departure at 5pm. I thought it would be a perfect timing to feel the <i>real</i> Japan.

        <h2>How I built this website, and what I would recommand for new bees </h2>
        <h5>09/01/2020</h5>
        <h5 style="color:purple">Angular</h5>
        <p> I have planned to build a personal website since 09/2019, have tried to implement in so many ways. And finally deployed it in 09/2020ÔºÅ
        <br>
        To be honest, a website doesn't take that long. The current verison of this website only took me less than a month. 
        <br>
        The hard part is to find the right way before you start!
